### How To Use This Page
A live version of this site can be found at [https://kajun.github.io/FEND-neighborhood-map/](https://kajun.github.io/FEND-neighborhood-map/ "FEND Neighborhood Map")
Due to the limitations of the free OpenWeatherMap.com API, the Weather Forecast will not work since Github Pages will only allow HTTPS calls. Unfortunately, the free API from OpenWeatherMap.com does not support HTTPS requests unless you're a paid subscriber. 
To view a working version, clone or download the repository and open the **index.html** file in your browser.
